#Glyph recognition experiment

1. Run npm install in glyphgen folder
2. Run node glyphgen.js in glyphgen folder
3. There should now exist a folder called "glyphs" containing 32 png images in that folder


4. Run cargo run. This will take quite a long time, like 30 minutes or so, but will generate 10k images and a datafile
5. datadescription.txt will contain imagename, data.gx, data.gy, data.glyph_id, data.glyph_present, data.rotation
